Hi! Few sentences about my skills:
- HTML
- CSS (SASS too)
- Beginner Javascript (to near future I hope more advanced)
- Beginner Web Design (UI/UX fundamentals)
- My passionate is literally all Front-End Development
- I interested more about Node.js, PHP but currently I can't do anything with that
- Database that: MySQL (and in the future maybe MongoDB as NoSQL language)
